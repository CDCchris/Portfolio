# Portfolio

https://cdcchris.github.io/Portfolio/

## Description

This portfolio has been created to show off some HTML and CSS that has been learnt over the last few weeks. It includes three main sections such as about me, my work and contact information. I created this to provide examples of work I have done and it will be updated regularly with new examples.

The navigation bar at the top right of the screen will link down to each section when the button is clicked.
